    <h3>What is Grid Based Design?</h3>
    <p>The grid based design is a layout designed to take full advantage of our natural way of reading websites. Our eyes naturally begin at the top left and work their way across the website title, and then down to a photo next to a paragraph title, followed by the paragraph itself.</p>
    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>Using responsive webpages is great beacause it ensures that no matter the device or screen size you use to access the website, it will resize automatically and make your webpage look great to the reader.</p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
    <p> Semantic structure is the HTML code we write that can be understood by both the browser and the people reading it. Examples of this include using "h1" to define you webpage's header or title.</p>
    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
    <p>The use of negative space really appealed to me. This is because it not only makes written content on the webpage easier to read, it also gives the website a simplistic and spacious look which I really like.</p>
