    <h1>Leadership</h1>

    <h4>Sunday 27 May 2018</h4>
  
    <h3> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
    <p>
        Personally I haven’t had much leadership experience, as I am still quite young, 
        but I absolutely see the importance of compassionate leadership. I feel as though 
        if we are compassionate, not just in a work situation but in all aspects of life 
        we will make ourselves and others thrive. If you’re a compassionate, understanding 
        and relatable leader, people are going to follow you.

    <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
    <p>
        I found this exercise very revitalising. The idea of perceiving goodness in everyone 
        frees the mind of grudges and judgements and allows you to relate, understand and share 
        goodness with them. I feel like regular use of this exercise could dramatically change 
        ones perception on the world.

    <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
    <p>
        During this exercise, at the stage where you imagine seeing someone in your life suffering, 
        that part of the exercise really stuck with me. I feel as through already I appreciate the 
        special people in my life that a care a lot about. This appreciation will continue to grow 
        as I continue to meditate.

    <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
        I think coming to the end of Phase 0 the one part of SCARF I can relate to most at the. Moment 
        is certainty. Do I know enough? Will I forget every thing on my first day of bootcamp? I loved 
        this quote “uncertainty takes away valuable brain resources”, it’s so true. Sometimes you can 
        have uncertain thoughts that will eat away at you, halting your work progress. I feel SCARF will 
        definitely be a key part of boot camp especially in team based situations. We need to be willing 
        to put aside our own motives and egos for the greater good of the task and the team.

    <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
    <p>
        I had a difficult conversation with a work colleague where they kept putting the tools that the 
        whole team uses in her desk drawer (for her ease of access to them). It does disadvantage our 
        team as it causes confusion and general delay of service to our customers.  I took a step back and 
        looked at both myself and her as work colleagues before I had the conversation with her. We could 
        be so much more efficient if we can sort this problem out and it was all down to how I conversed 
        with her about it. I didn’t make a drama or get anyone else involved, I just sat down with her, 
        in a open-minded environment and was honest without being hurtful, constructive without being 
        critical.
