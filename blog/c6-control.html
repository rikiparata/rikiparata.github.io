    <h3> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a 
         disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
    <p>
        Getting blocked on a set of code or a project is a huge trigger for 
        me and causes a disproportionate emotional response. I just want to 
        keep progressing and keep my flow but can’t find a way to move past 
        my mistake. A technique I regularly use is taking a good break from 
        the screen, getting some fresh air and try again later.

    <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise 
        (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
    <p>
        After trying out this exercise (and this sounds weird) I’m looking 
        forward to the next time I am in a ‘triggered’ situation. I’m looking 
        forward to seeing how I will handle it. Will I identify the emotion my 
        body is feeling? Or will I rage quit! I can definitely see this method, 
        especially the “Stop, Breath” aspect being usable in programming and 
        even more so in every day life. That pause that gives me time to choose 
        my response allows me to speak logically and not just emotionally.
