    <h3>The relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
    <p>
        The relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness starts with our perspective 
        on ourselves, how we see ourselves. We need to firstly be openly honest. Accept our 
        strengths and weaknesses for what they are and be comfortable with who we are. If we 
        can have this mixture of emotional awareness and honest self assessment, we will exert 
        mindfulness and become more self confident.

    <h3>Journaling</h3>
    <p>
        I have actually been keeping a journal since the start of the year. I use it to note down 
        general thoughts, project ideas, opportunities and goals (as well as grocery shopping list!). 
        I however have never really written my feelings down on paper before. I tried the journaling 
        exercise and found a lot of satisfaction in it. Some questions I can relate to my work environment 
        where I am constantly trying to met/beat deadlines to ensure a satisfied customer.

    <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
    <p>
        To realise that ourselves and our emotions are two separate things is so important. 
        Once we understand that this emotion is just a feeling and that it will in time pass, we can 
        look upon it with more optimism. 
        “Fundamentally, I can act on my emotions because they are not my core being.”
