I recently had trouble running my javascript code because of a syntax error in a large javascript paragraph. Firstly studied my code as closely as possible to seek out the faults. Secondly I compared my paragraph to the given examples to find where I went wrong. Comparing to the examples given allowed me to find that I had added a comma instead of a semicolon. It felt good to do it myself and not ask for help in that instance (it is important to know when to ask for help). To be very specific when coding, otherwise the computer will spit it back at me!

Reflect:
I always feel it’s very important for me to at the very least try figure out a bug by myself. The feeling of identifying and fixing a bug is great and motivates me to code more. Other techniques I use are obviously examples given, GOOGLE, then if I’m really struggling peers and the Slack community. I feel confident using the resources to help me learn and improve my code.
