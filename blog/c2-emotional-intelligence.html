    <h3>
        What learnings did you take from the chapter?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Before reading Chapter 1 of 'Search Inside Yourself', 
        I didn't realise the huge part that emotional intelligence 
        played in the success of one's self, career and life. The 
        ability to be great at a skill in a workplace is only half 
        the deal. The ability to understand how to work with others 
        both physically (coursework, projects) and emotionally (being 
        friendly, showing empathy) is what will set you apart from the 
        crowd and give you an edge. Great leaders aren't born and 
        emotional intelligence isn't either. It takes time to learn 
        but it without a doubt will improve your drive and work performance.

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
        The mindfulness (and meditation in general) is more or less a 
        completely new experience for me. It is something I am willing to 
        experiment with after seeing countless benefits in this assignment 
        as well as previous. I tried it for the first time last night and I 
        found myself in a really relaxed state, just happy 'being'.
