    <h2>The Enspiral Dev Academy Experience</h2>
  
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>My take on the experience between both DBC and EDA is that what you get out of it directly corresponds to what you put into it. It only works if you and everyone around you apply yourself. Everyone is in the same boat.</p>

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>Throughout EDA, some students know a large amount, some know a smaller amount. Whatever learning stage of web development you are at, you have a responsibility to work hard and make the most of your opportunity here.</p>
   
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>If I can prepare myself to make mistakes, prepare to fail, then I will learn so much more. The type of culture that EDA offers is a great environment for creators to express themselves and that's something I am very excited about being a part of.</p>
   
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Looking at EDA from the outside and then coming into Phase 0 and getting a feel for the culture of EDA, I have realised the importance of collaboration. Making mistakes and learning from those mistakes together can teach me so much more than if I was learning individually. These soft skills I will learn throughout the course are extremely valuable to me as I begin my career in IT.</p>
   
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    </h3>
    
    <p>Definitely a mix of excitement and nervousness. Coding is a completely new skill to me up until a few months ago when I tried a few HTML and CSS courses on Code Academy. I'm intrigued to experience the environment EDA has to offer as it is completely different to anything I have experienced.</p>
