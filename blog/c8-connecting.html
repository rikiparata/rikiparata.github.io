    <h3> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing 
         trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
    <p>
        I haven’t yet tried any techniques in real life yet but I found the 
        idea of making tough decisions with kindness and empathy interesting. 
        The way we conduct ourselves in situations like this can affect us and 
        our interests in the short and log term.

    <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
    <p>
        I did get to use empathic listening a few days ago at work, we have
         a new lady learning our computer system and I was helping her out. 
         When I was going through it with her, I took myself back to those 
         overwhelming, nervous, unconfident feelings I felt when I started 
         using the computer systems. It allowed me to relate to her, show 
         empathy and I think she appreciated that.

    <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
    <p>
        Approaching the meditation from a position of equality, with both 
        yourself and your partner, allowed a positive and nonjudgemental 
        experience. I really liked the quote in the chapter “This person 
        wishes to be happy, just like me!”
