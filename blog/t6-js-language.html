    <h3> Define the following:</h3>

    <h4>Parentheses</h4>
    <p>
        A parentheses is a space between brackets that defines 
        what a function is and what the function is going to do.
        Example: var result = doSomething()
    </p>

    <h4>Square Brackets</h4>
    <p>
       The square brackets are used to access arrays.
       It's important to note that when accessing an array, the index counting starts at '0' instead of '1'.
       Example: ([0], [1], [2], [3])
    </p>

    <h4>Curly Braces</h4>
    <p>
       The curly braces are used in functions and used to add values to objects.
       They are seen at the start and end of functions.
       Example: function start () {
           ...
       }
    </p>

    <h4>Single Quotes</h4>
    <p>
       Single quotes are used to define strings in JavaScript.
       They can also be used inside of double quotes rather than having to 
       use backslashes or escaping the quote all together.
    </p>

    <h4>Double Quotes</h4>
    <p>
       Double quotes are almost identical to single quotes except they can't be 
       used to escape a quote and then return as single quotes can.
