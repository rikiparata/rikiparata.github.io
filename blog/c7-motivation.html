    <h2>Motivation</h2>
  
    <h3> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
    <p>
        Tan Chade-Meng, the author of Search Inside Yourself, describes pleasure as 
        a state of being high on happiness with a short duration, passion as a state 
        of flow/excellent performance with a medium duration, and higher purpose as 
        a state of “being part of something bigger than yourself”. How can we apply 
        these different forms of happiness to our lives? Tan suggests instead of 
        being short sighted and focusing excelling as fast as possible, we should 
        look at the big picture for something that has personal meaning to us. Once 
        we find that higher purpose, the rest will follow.
    </p>

    <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core 
        values? What do you stand for?</h3>
    <p>
        This might sound childish because I’m sure it is something everyone was told 
        when they were growing up but one of my most important values I hold at the 
        core is having manners. It takes absolutely no skill at all to smile at 
        someone, say good morning, hold the door open for the elderly, look a person 
        in the eyes when you shake there hand, you get what I mean. Just treat people 
        the way you would want to be treated, this is primary school easy! This world 
        would be a different place if we all did that.

    <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>

    <p>
        The meditation exercise was interesting to me as it made me ask some questions 
        I haven’t really asked myself before. Where is my place in this world? I love
        the idea of the meditation exercises asking me best case scenario, where do I 
        see myself in five years? Often I personally find myself looking always in the 
        long term which isn’t really what I want to be doing, I want to enjoy the present! 
        I guess the only difference between my normal look to the future and this exercise 
        is that this exercise made me think if my most optimistic expectations were exceeded, 
        where would I be and what would I be doing? 

        In terms of resilience ideas, I really liked the metaphor from Matthieu Ricard  “Think 
        of happiness as a deep ocean. The surface may be choppy, but the bottom is always calm.”. 
        This spoke to me a lot as there are always going to be set backs and ups and downs in this 
        life but if we can gain that inner calm/peace, we can bounce back and always be resilient.
