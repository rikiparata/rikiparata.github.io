        What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
    </h3>
    <p>
       Since reading chapter one I had learnt that meditation was a powerful tool that 
       could not only be used for relaxing and clarity reasons, but also focus and calmness 
       that could be applied in work situations.
    </p>

    <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
    <p>
        A new thing I learnt in this chapter was that happiness is our defult, happiness is 
        being. It was an interesting idea that happiness is not something we look for or pursue 
        but rather our state of being that we can always return to.
    </p>
    <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
    <p>
       A basic meditation technique that worked for me was just pulling myself back to attention.
       Sometimes I feel as though there is so much going on in my head so I need to remeber to bring 
       myself back when I get distracted.
    </p>

    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed the paragraph that talked about letting distractions be. Inviting the 
        distraction to leave or stay and either way be in a happy and peaceful state of being.
