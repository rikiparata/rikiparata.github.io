    <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h3>
    <p>
        A responsive site is a web page that changes automatically depending on the 
        user's device and screen size. If your website is not responsive, it will take 
        away from the user experience, which is the exact opposite of what you want to do. 
        If a visitor to your site has to zoom into the text because its too small or scroll 
        right on the screen because they can't read a full sentence, then that person's 
        experience will be frustrating and they're less likely to spend time on your website.

    <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h3>
    <p>
        The mobile first design is the concept to  build a website specifically mobile friendly 
        in both size and design, and then go on to produce it for larger screens like tablets and 
        desktops. This ensures that all of the key information is available on screen and that it 
        is not overcrowded. If we were to design our web page off desktop dimensions, we would have 
        to cut a lot out of our mobile view. Also, something to note, more people are viewing web 
        content on their mobile devices compared to laptops and desktops, so it makes sense to first 
        make your website mobile friendly.

    <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h3>
    <p>
        Frameworks are templates of code, such as HTML and CSS, that allow a simpler approach to 
        coding as you can just fill it in and have a website in a short amount of time.
        The pros of using framework are that there are great web designs out there and they are 
        easily accessible and encouraged. Alongside that, you don't have to fully copy a webpage 
        design! You can copy it and then change it to make it your own.
        The cons are it allows you to get a bit lazy in terms of creativity and making something 
        brand new. It is good practice to build your code yourself and can make it easier to identify 
        faults if you start having problems with your webpage.

    <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h3>
    <p>
            The wireframe method is using rows and columns to put each element of our webpage exactly 
            where we want it to go. We use it because it helps us visualise what our website will look like.

    <div class="row">
            <div class="three columns">
              <img class="wire-images" src="images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-mobile">
                <p class="caption"><i>Mobile Index Page Wireframe</i></p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="three columns">
              <img class="wire-images" src="images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-index-desktop">
                <p class="caption"><i>Desktop Index Page Wireframe</i></p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="three columns">
              <img class="wire-images" src="images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe-blog-mobile">
                <p class="caption"><i>Mobile Blog Page Wireframe</i></p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="three columns">
              <img class="wire-images" src="images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe-blog-desktop">
                <p class="caption"><i>Desktop Blog Page Wireframe</i></p>
            </div>
          </div>
    
    <h3>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h3>
     <p>
            Just understanding the whole concept really. I feel like its something I do need 
            to keep revising and practising. It is another thing that the more I do it, the 
            better I'll get.
